## About this project :bug:

Yep, it's like a generic movies site, maybe you can't see the movies, but yo can see the trailers...if there are availables :B

You can:

    ✔ Check a synopsis for the movies.
    ✔ Make a favorites list.
    ✔ Search for and specific movie.

Note:warning:

If you cloned the repo and want to try it locale, you need a `Key API`, don't worry you can get it in [themoviedb](https://www.themoviedb.org/):movie_camera:

And when you have it, create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project, the content of the file it will be: `NEXT_PUBLIC_ APIKEY="YOUR API KEY HERE WITHOUT THE QUOTES"`:heart_on_fire:

## API

This is the API where i consulted the data, if you can, go and check it out.

`IS AMAZING` :heart_on_fire:
